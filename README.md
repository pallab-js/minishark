## Features

-   **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Linux and Windows.

-   **Multiple Output Formats**: Export captures to standard **JSON** for data analysis or **PCAP** for viewing in tools like Wireshark.
-   **Powerful Filtering**: Filter traffic by protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP), IP address, or port number.
-   **Real-time Display**: View packets as they are captured, with color-coded protocols for easy identification.
-   **Memory Safe**: Includes a configurable memory limit to prevent excessive resource consumption during long captures.
